Lesson 1: Introduction to Java

What is Java?

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language.
Developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle).
Known for its platform independence and "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy.
History of Java:

Developed in the mid-1990s.
Initially intended for programming embedded systems.
Evolved into a versatile language used for a wide range of applications.
Features of Java:

Platform Independence: Java programs can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Robust: Strong type checking, exception handling, and garbage collection enhance reliability.
Secure: Built-in security features, including a secure execution environment.
Portable: Code is portable across different platforms.
Object-Oriented: Java is based on object-oriented principles.
Java Development Environment Setup:

Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer.
Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA for easier development.
Writing and Running a Simple Java Program:

A basic Java program consists of a class declaration and a main method.
Create a "Hello, World!" program:
java
Copy code
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
Data Types in Java:

Java has several built-in data types, including int, double, char, and boolean.
Variables and Constants:

Variables are used to store data. They have a data type and a name.
Constants are declared with the final keyword and store unchanging values.
Basic Input and Output (I/O):

Use System.out.println() to display output in the console.
The Scanner class allows you to read input from the console.
Comments and Documentation:

Comments are used to add explanations to code.
JavaDoc is used to generate code documentation.
Practical Exercises:

Write a simple "Hello, World!" program.
Declare and use variables and constants.
Use basic I/O to display information.
Add comments to code for documentation.
Homework Assignment:

Write a Java program that takes a user's name as input and prints a personalized greeting.
Homework Review:

Review and discussion of the homework assignment.
Summary:

In this lesson, we introduced Java as a versatile, platform-independent programming language.
We set up the Java development environment, wrote a basic program, and covered key language features like data types, variables, constants, and I/O.
The homework assignment encouraged students to apply what they learned in a practical scenario.
This lesson forms the foundation for the subsequent lessons, where we will delve deeper into Java programming concepts and techniques.
